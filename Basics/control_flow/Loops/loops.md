# Loops

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

Loops repeat an action some number of times.(Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

- [for loop statement]

- [break statement]

- [continue]

- [while loop statement]

- [do while loop statement]
